# Description of Purpose
SymptoLogger is designed to allow the user to keep track of symptoms or health concerns that they would later like to discuss with the doctor. Using SymptoLogger will enable users to keep track of changes in their symptomatology, and share these changes with their health care providers to enable efficient diagnosis and treatment. See the wiki for detailed breakdown of functionality and design implementation.

# _SymptoLogger_
This application has been developed by Remi Arshad, Noni Hua, Jason Lee, Patrick Tamm and Kaiwen Zhang. It is their submission for the group project for the Fall 2018 session of CMPUT 301 at the University of Alberta. The application was developed under the guidance of Zharkyn Kassenov, one of the TAs for the course. Please note that this README is not intended to act as a detailed overview of the functionality of the app; rather, it is intended to give a brief description of purpose. For detailed documentation and references, please consult the [project wiki](https://github.com/CMPUT301F18T02/SymptoLogger/wiki).

# Description of Purpose
_SymptoLogger_ is designed to allow the user to keep track of symptoms or health concerns that they would later like to discuss with the doctor. Using SymptoLogger will enable users to keep track of changes in their symptomatology, and share these changes with their health care providers to enable efficient diagnosis and treatment. See the wiki for detailed breakdown of functionality and design implementation.
